# Audio Play Download Automation of daily "Sendung mit der Maus" content
My son loves the Sendung mit der Maus, and so do I (since my early childhood, in fact).
The [Sendung mit der Maus](https://www.wdrmaus.de/) is an excellent series of educational and creative media published by the [Westdeutsche Rundfink KÃ¶ln (WDR)](https://www.wdr.de).
The format appears weekly on Television since 1971 and as a Stream.
Since the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, there is also a series of freely streamable and as mp3 file downloadable daily audio plays.

For some weird reason however, in germany publicly funded and freely available media gets depublished after (approximately) one week of online availability. In the past, I have tried to keep track of the newly published episodes, but some slipped between my fingers. I therefore set out to create this small automation tool (which can be run as a cron job, for example) to automatically collect and download any newly appearing mp3 audio files.

This tool is built with python and uses selenium to request the full html source code of the php pages in order to extract and then download newly published mp3 files for safekeeping. Only the mp3 files not already present in the output directory will be downloaded. Existing files will be skipped.

## Installation on Debian-based systems
For use with Firefox:
  ```
  sudo apt install -y firefox firefox-geckodriver
  ```

For use with Chrome/Chromium:
  ```
  sudo apt install -y chromium-browser chromium-chromedriver
  ```

Installing the required python packages
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

Optional (for the use of [toniefy.py](./toniefy.py). See below])
  ```
  sudo apt install -y ffmpeg
  ```

## How to use

Everything is pretty straight forward, if you follow the documentation:

  ```
  $python main.py --help

  Usage: main.py [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -c, --content TEXT      What is the target content to download? pick
                          'gutenacht' (default) for 'Gute Nacht mit der Maus',
                          'hoerspiel' for 'Maus Hoerspiel', i.e. stories etc,
                          'podcast' for a full hour Maus podcast (i.e. the
                          listen-only-equivalent of the regular weekly
                          'Sending mit der Maus' episodes on TV or Stream, or
                          'musik' for content all about music. This content
                          selection will create a correspondingly named folder
                          in your choice of output directory.
  -b, --browser TEXT      Which browser to use for? Pick between 'firefox' and
                          'chrome' (default).
  -w, --waittime INTEGER  Time in seconds to allow the browser to request
                          resources and render. Default wait time is 10
                          seconds.
  -o, --output TEXT       The output directory to create (if required) and
                          write the discovered files into. Default output
                          directory is '.'.
  --help                  Show this message and exit.
  ```

## Toniebox-readification

The daily podcast and music episodes are thematically aligned and of roughly 60 and 30 minutes of duration, respectively. If you own a [Toniebox](https://tonies.com/) with a [Creative Tonie](https://tonies.com/en-gb/creative-tonies/), which comes with 90 minutes of capacity to play back custom content, you can conveniently select (and slightly preprocess) a podcast with matching musical content using [toniefy.py](./toniefy.py).
Since together the podcast and music files of a day of choice typically slightly exceed the 90 minute capacity of the Creative Tonie, [toniefy.py](./toniefy.py) infers the minimal required increase in playback speed and then uses [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to process the files to not exceed the figurine's capacity when uploaded together. Note that in order to use this script, [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) needs to be installed on the executing device (see installation instructions above.)

Follow the instructions, by providing the YEAR, MONTH and DAY corresponding to the publication of your previously with [main.py](./main.py) downloaded Maus-episodes as digits. The script will output processed mp3-files to a (default) location (of choice) which can then be uploaded to the Tonie via your Toniebox-account.

```
Usage: toniefy.py [OPTIONS] YEAR MONTH DAY

  (1) Takes the podcast and music mp3 files corresponding to a given date
  string (which usually are topically aligned), (2) measures their length in
  time (usually slightly over 90 minutes in length when added up) (3) and then uses
  ffmpeg to change playback speed to get just under 90 minutes of play time.
  (4) the end result can then be uploaded conveniently to a "Creative-Tonie"
  (with 90min capacity) for Toniebox-playback. see https://tonies.com/en-
  gb/creative-tonies/

Options:
  -o, --output TEXT  The output location of choice.
  --help             Show this message and exit.
```

## Filename cleanup

From time to time, the mp3-files provided on the Maus streaming page change naming patterns. This may slip through and a lot of content might be downloaded before this change in naming convention is discovered. For this reason, I provide [renamer.py](./renamer.py), which can be used to post-hoc clean up the downloaded files' names in order to increase clarity of naming.
The current renaming policies in this file are reflected in the main executable [main.py](./main.py) as well, affecting any future downloads.
